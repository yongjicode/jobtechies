## Introduction {#introduction-id}
For this hackathon, we chose to tackle problem statement 3 under the CSIT track.
The problem we have identified is that in our modern job landscape, the lifecycle for tech jobs are getting shorter, and information on the available tech jobs isnâ€™t readily available.

Such information gap between the available job options and what individual are aware of may cause them to be unable to prepare themselves aptly for the changing job market.
Moreover, the wide array of job choices makes it difficult for job seekers to navigate and explore possible career paths, less choose a job that is the right fit.

This presents us with 3 main opportunities, to help job seekers to navigate the career paths in the tech industry, to raise awareness of the tech jobs available, and lastly, to assist job seekers in advertising themselves, starting from developing effective resumes.
